## Interactive Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer
A sleek, modern web application for visualizing and interacting with fundamental data structures like Binary Search Trees, Linked Lists, and Graphs. This project is a hands-on learning tool built with React that provides a dynamic and intuitive way to understand how data structures work.

Users can insert, delete, search, and traverse nodes, with all operations visualized in real-time through smooth animations. The interface is designed to be clean, modern, and user-friendly, featuring an animated grid background and a polished component-based UI.

## âœ¨ Key Features
Three Core Structures: Visualize and manipulate:

Binary Search Trees: Insert, delete, search, and perform In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals.

Singly Linked Lists: Append, prepend, delete, and search for nodes.

Undirected Graphs: Add nodes and edges, and visualize DFS & BFS traversals from any starting node.

Interactive Controls: Full control to add/remove elements, search for values, and initiate complex algorithms.

Real-time Visualization: All operations are animated step-by-step to clearly illustrate the underlying processes.

Modern UI/UX: A responsive and visually appealing interface built with pure CSS, featuring a unique animated grid background and glassmorphism-style panels.

Analytics & Insights: A dedicated panel displays key metrics like tree height, node count, graph density, and operational status.

Quick Reference Guide: An integrated panel provides time complexities and common use cases for each data structure, acting as a handy cheat sheet.
